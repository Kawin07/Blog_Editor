Great! Since this is an assignment and you **need to submit your `.env` file along with the project**, here's the best way to do it **while keeping everything clean and clear for your mentor**.

---

### ✅ Final `.env` File (include this in your repo)

You **can upload this** to your GitHub repo since it's an assignment with a shared database.

```env
# .env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://kawin0275:Kawin%402005@cluster0.niwbmul.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
PORT=5000
```

> ✅ Save this as `.env` in the `/server` folder and include it in your GitHub repo (just for this assignment).

---

### ✅ Clean README.md (Assignment Version)

Here’s a simple and clear `README.md` file for submission:
